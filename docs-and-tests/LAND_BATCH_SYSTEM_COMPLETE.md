# 🏞️ LAND MARKET BATCH SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ **LAND BATCH SYSTEM SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Your Land Market now has the same button-controlled batch system as the Property Market, showing exactly 5 land plots sorted by price when the button is clicked.

---

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **1. GameContext.js Updates**

#### New State Fields:
```javascript
// Land market batch system
currentLandBatch: [], // Array of 5 land plot objects
landBatchPurchased: [], // Array of land plot IDs purchased from current batch
```

#### New Functions Added:
- `getEligibleLandPlotsForLevel(level, excludeOwned)` - Filters land plots by player level and ownership
- `generateNewLandBatch()` - Creates batch of 5 land plots **sorted by price (ascending)**
- `isCurrentLandBatchCompleted()` - Checks if all 5 plots have been purchased
- `trackLandPurchaseFromBatch(landPlotId)` - Tracks purchases from current batch

#### Enhanced Functions:
- `buyLand()` - Now calls `trackLandPurchaseFromBatch()` after successful purchase
- Context value exports all new land batch functions

---

### **2. LandMarketScreen.js Complete Redesign**

#### New UI Logic:
- **Initial State**: Shows "Show Land Plots" button, no land plots visible
- **After Button Click**: Displays 5 land plots from current batch, sorted by price
- **Purchase Tracking**: Land plots remain visible but show "SOLD" overlay when purchased
- **Batch Completion**: When all 5 plots are purchased, "Show New Land Plots" button appears

#### Key Features:
- **Button-Controlled Display**: Land plots hidden by default, revealed by button
- **Price Sorting**: Land plots sorted from cheapest to most expensive
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows "X / 5 sold" with visual progress bar
- **SOLD Overlays**: Visual indication of purchased land plots
- **Negotiation Modal**: Preserved original negotiation and purchasing flow

---

## 🎯 **USER EXPERIENCE**

### **Initial Visit**
- Shows prominent "Show Land Plots" button
- Button includes map icon and descriptive text
- "Discover 5 new land plots sorted by price" subtitle

### **After Button Click**
- Displays exactly 5 land plots sorted by asking price (lowest to highest)
- Each plot shows: name, location type, size, and asking price
- Tap any plot to open negotiation modal with price slider

### **During Purchases**
- Purchased plots show red "SOLD" overlay
- Progress indicator at bottom shows "Land Plots: X / 5 sold"
- Green progress bar fills as plots are purchased

### **Batch Complete**
- When all 5 plots are sold, "Show New Land Plots" button reappears
- Click generates fresh batch of 5 new eligible plots

---

## 🔄 **SORTING & FILTERING LOGIC**

### **Level Filtering**
```javascript
// Only shows land plots the player can afford based on level
eligibleLandPlots = LAND_PLOT_LIST.filter(plot => 
  playerLevel >= plot.minLevel
);
```

### **Ownership Filtering**
```javascript
// Excludes already owned land plots
const ownedLandIds = playerAssets
  .filter(asset => asset.assetType === 'Land')
  .map(asset => asset.id.split('_')[0]);
eligibleLandPlots = eligibleLandPlots.filter(plot => 
  !ownedLandIds.includes(plot.id)
);
```

### **Price Sorting**
```javascript
// Sorts by asking price from lowest to highest
const sorted = [...eligibleLandPlots].sort((a, b) => 
  a.askingPrice - b.askingPrice
);
const newBatch = sorted.slice(0, 5);
```
