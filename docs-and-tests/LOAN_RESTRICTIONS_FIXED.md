# 🏦 LOAN RESTRICTION SYSTEM - FIXED

## ✅ **LOAN RESTRICTION ISSUE RESOLVED**

The loan system has been fixed to allow taking loans from different banks while maintaining proper restrictions based on loan type.

---

## 🐛 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Previous (Incorrect) Behavior:**
- ❌ **Personal Loans**: Could only have ONE personal loan total (from any bank)
- ❌ **Mortgage Loans**: Could only have ONE mortgage total (on any property)

### **Root Cause:**
The `takeLoan` function was using overly restrictive logic:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN) LOGIC:
const existingLoan = state.activeLoans.find(loan => 
  loan.type === loanDetails.type && 
  (loanDetails.type === 'Personal' || loan.assetId === loanDetails.assetId)
);
```

This meant:
- For Personal loans: Blocked ANY new personal loan if ANY personal loan existed
- For Mortgage loans: Worked correctly (blocked only same property)

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **New (Correct) Behavior:**
- ✅ **Personal Loans**: Can have multiple personal loans from DIFFERENT banks
- ❌ **Personal Loans**: Cannot have multiple personal loans from SAME bank  
- ✅ **Mortgage Loans**: Can have multiple mortgages on DIFFERENT properties
- ❌ **Mortgage Loans**: Cannot have multiple mortgages on SAME property

### **Fixed Logic:**
```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) LOGIC:
const existingLoan = state.activeLoans.find(loan => {
  if (loanDetails.type === 'Personal') {
    // For personal loans, only restrict if taking from the same bank
    return loan.type === 'Personal' && loan.bank === loanDetails.bank;
  } else {
    // For mortgage loans, restrict if same property (regardless of bank)
    return loan.type === 'Mortgage' && loan.assetId === loanDetails.assetId;
  }
});
```

---

## 🔧 **FILES MODIFIED**

### **1. GameContext.js - Core Logic Fix**

#### Updated `takeLoan()` Function:
```javascript
const existingLoan = state.activeLoans.find(loan => {
  if (loanDetails.type === 'Personal') {
    // For personal loans, only restrict if taking from the same bank
    return loan.type === 'Personal' && loan.bank === loanDetails.bank;
  } else {
    // For mortgage loans, restrict if same property (regardless of bank)
    return loan.type === 'Mortgage' && loan.assetId === loanDetails.assetId;
  }
});
```

#### Enhanced Error Messages:
```javascript
if (existingLoan) {
  if (loanDetails.type === 'Personal') {
    Alert.alert("Loan Already Exists", 
      `You already have an active Personal loan from ${loanDetails.bank}.`);
  } else {
    Alert.alert("Loan Already Exists", 
      `You already have an active Mortgage loan on this property.`);
  }
  return false;
}
```

### **2. LoanScreen.js - UI Logic Fix**

#### Updated `existingLoan` Check:
```javascript
const existingLoan = useMemo(() => {
  return activeLoans.find(loan => {
    if (loanType === 'Personal') {
      // For personal loans, check if there's already a personal loan from this bank
      return loan.type === 'Personal' && loan.bank === bank.name;
    } else {
      // For mortgage loans, check if this property already has a mortgage
      return loan.type === 'Mortgage' && loan.assetId === selectedProperty?.id;
    }
  });
}, [activeLoans, loanType, bank.name, selectedProperty?.id]);
```

#### Enhanced UI Error Messages:
```javascript
<Text style={styles.noticeText}>
  {loanType === 'Personal' 
    ? `You already have an active Personal loan from ${bank.name}.` 
    : `You already have an active Mortgage loan on ${selectedProperty?.name}.`
  }
</Text>
```
