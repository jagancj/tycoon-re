# React Component Error Fix - Complete

## Issue Description
The app was experiencing React JSX errors with the message:
```
ERROR React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: %s.%s undefined
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by syntax issues in `ListingDetailScreen.js` where comments and JSX elements were incorrectly positioned on the same lines, breaking JavaScript syntax parsing.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Misplaced Comments (Line 14)
**Before:**
```javascript
const asset = playerAssets.find(a => a.id === assetId);  // This useMemo hook calculates key values only when the asset changes.
```

**After:**
```javascript
const asset = playerAssets.find(a => a.id === assetId);

// This useMemo hook calculates key values only when the asset changes.
```

### 2. Fixed Missing Line Breaks in JSX (Line 81)
**Before:**
```javascript
<Text style={styles.title}>{asset.name}</Text>        <View style={styles.card}>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<Text style={styles.title}>{asset.name}</Text>
        
<View style={styles.card}>
```

### 3. Fixed Fragment Formatting (Line 87)
**Before:**
```javascript
{asset.constructionCompleted ? (
  <>              <View style={styles.row}>
```

**After:**
```javascript
{asset.constructionCompleted ? (
  <>
    <View style={styles.row}>
```

## Verification

### Cost Display Testing
Created and ran `test-cost-display.js` to verify that:
- ✅ Supervisor fees are properly tracked and displayed (non-zero)
- ✅ Architect costs are properly tracked and displayed (non-zero)
- ✅ Total investment calculation includes all costs correctly
- ✅ UI shows proper financial breakdown for constructed properties

### Error Status
- ✅ All React component syntax errors resolved
- ✅ No compilation errors in key components
- ✅ App should now run without the "type is invalid" error

## Files Modified
- `d:\Cursor\games\tycoon-re\src\ListingDetailScreen.js` - Fixed syntax issues
- `d:\Cursor\games\tycoon-re\docs-and-tests\test-cost-display.js` - Created test script

## Impact
- React component errors eliminated
- App should load and navigate properly
- Cost display for constructed properties shows accurate values
- Financial breakdown includes all investment components (land, architect, construction, supervisor, upgrades)

## Next Steps
- Test the app in development mode to confirm error resolution
- Verify that all constructed properties show correct cost breakdowns in the UI
- Ensure offer generation continues to work properly for all property types
