# Marketplace Redesign Implementation

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the property marketplace from an automatic system showing 7 properties to a static, button-controlled system showing 5 properties at a time.

## Changes Made

### 1. GameContext.js Updates

#### New State Fields:
- `currentMarketplaceBatch`: Array of 5 property objects currently available in the marketplace
- `marketplaceBatchPurchased`: Array of property IDs that have been purchased from the current batch

#### New Functions:
- `getEligiblePropertiesForLevel(level)`: Filters properties based on player level, owned properties, and sold properties
- `shuffleArray(array)`: Utility function to randomize property order
- `generateNewMarketplaceBatch()`: Creates a new batch of 5 level-appropriate properties
- `isCurrentBatchCompleted()`: Checks if all properties in the current batch have been purchased
- `trackPropertyPurchaseFromBatch(propertyId)`: Tracks when a property from the current batch is purchased

#### Integration:
- Updated `buyProperty()` function to track purchases from the current batch
- Added new marketplace functions to the context value
- Updated save state logic to persist marketplace state

### 2. PropertyMarketScreen.js Complete Redesign

#### New UI Logic:
- **Initial State**: Shows "Show Properties" button, no properties visible
- **After Button Click**: Displays 5 properties from current batch, hides button
- **Purchase Tracking**: Properties remain visible but show as "SOLD" when purchased
- **Batch Completion**: When all 5 properties are purchased, "Show New Properties" button appears

#### New Components:
- `ShowPropertiesButton`: Large, prominent button to generate new property batches
- `ListEmptyMessage`: Message shown when current batch is exhausted
- Progress indicator showing how many properties have been sold from current batch

#### Enhanced Property Cards:
- Added property type display
- Visual "SOLD" overlay for purchased properties
- Improved styling and animations

### 3. Features Implemented

#### Button-Controlled System:
- ✅ Properties hidden by default
- ✅ "Show Properties" button reveals exactly 5 properties
- ✅ Button disappears when properties are shown
- ✅ Button reappears when all 5 properties are sold

#### Property Management:
- ✅ Level-appropriate property filtering
- ✅ Excludes already owned properties
- ✅ Excludes previously sold properties
- ✅ Randomized property selection
- ✅ Tracking of purchases from current batch

#### User Experience:
- ✅ Progress indicator showing batch completion
- ✅ Visual feedback for sold properties
- ✅ Clear messaging about marketplace state
- ✅ Smooth transitions between states

## Technical Details

### State Management:
```javascript
// Initial state
currentMarketplaceBatch: [], // No properties shown initially
marketplaceBatchPurchased: [], // No purchases tracked

// After generateNewMarketplaceBatch()
currentMarketplaceBatch: [prop1, prop2, prop3, prop4, prop5], // 5 properties
marketplaceBatchPurchased: [], // Reset purchase tracking

// After purchases
marketplaceBatchPurchased: ["PROP123", "PROP456"], // Tracks purchased property IDs
```

### Button Logic:
```javascript
const shouldShowButton = currentMarketplaceBatch.length === 0 || isCurrentBatchCompleted();
```

### Property Filtering:
1. Filter by player level requirement
2. Exclude owned properties
3. Exclude sold properties
4. Shuffle remaining properties
5. Take first 5 properties

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Initial Load**: Verify "Show Properties" button appears on first visit
2. **Button Functionality**: Click button should show exactly 5 properties
3. **Purchase Tracking**: Buy properties and verify they're tracked correctly
4. **Batch Completion**: When all 5 are bought, button should reappear
5. **Level Progression**: Higher level players should see appropriate properties
6. **State Persistence**: Marketplace state should persist through app restarts

## Future Enhancements

- Add different property batch sizes for different player levels
- Implement property refresh timers (e.g., new properties every 24 hours)
- Add special "premium" property batches with rare properties
- Include property recommendations based on player portfolio
- Add batch purchasing discounts for buying multiple properties

## Files Modified

1. `GameContext.js` - Added marketplace state and functions
2. `src/PropertyMarketScreen.js` - Complete UI redesign
3. `MARKETPLACE_REDESIGN.md` - This documentation

## Migration Notes

The new system maintains backward compatibility with existing save files. Players with existing saves will start with an empty marketplace batch and can use the "Show Properties" button to begin the new system.
