# CONSTRUCTION ASKING PRICE FIX - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Description
Constructed properties were showing extremely low asking prices (95K) compared to their actual market value (1.1M), because the listing screen was only using land purchase price instead of total investment.

## Root Cause
In `ListingDetailScreen.js`, the investment calculation was:
```javascript
const investment = asset.invested || asset.purchasePrice || 0;
```

For completed construction projects, this only considered the original land price, ignoring:
- Construction costs (all phases)
- Supervisor fees
- Blueprint costs

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Investment Calculation**
```javascript
// OLD: Only land price
const investment = asset.invested || asset.purchasePrice || 0;

// NEW: Full investment for construction projects
const investment = asset.totalInvestment || asset.invested || asset.purchasePrice || 0;
```

### 2. **Enhanced Financial Summary Display**
Added conditional display for completed construction projects:

#### **For Completed Construction Projects:**
- Land Cost: $X
- Construction Cost: $Y  
- Supervisor Fee: $Z
- Upgrades Value: $W (if any)
- **Total Investment: $(X+Y+Z+W)**
- **Market Value: $M**

#### **For Regular Properties:**
- Purchase Price: $X
- Invested (Reno/Upgrades): $Y
- **Total Investment: $(X+Y)**
- **Market Value: $M**

### 3. **Proper Asking Price Range**
- **Minimum**: Total investment (break-even)
- **Initial Suggestion**: 110% of total investment (10% profit)
- **Maximum**: 150% of total investment (50% profit)

## Example Before vs After

- **Asking Price Range**: $650K - $975K (full investment!)
