# RENOVATION SYSTEM - TESTING GUIDE

## 📋 Pre-Testing Checklist

### Files Modified:
✅ **GameContext.js** - Core renovation logic with timeout mechanism
✅ **StaffSelectionScreen.js** - Staff assignment interface  
✅ **PortfolioScreen.js** - Progress display and controls (previously fixed)

### Key Improvements Implemented:
- ⏱️ **10-second renovation timer** (RENOVATION_TIME_MS = 10000)
- 🔄 **20-second timeout failsafe** (RENOVATION_TIMEOUT_MS = 20000)
- 📊 **Real-time progress tracking** with staff efficiency bonuses
- 💰 **Automatic value addition** when renovation completes
- 👥 **Staff return to agency** upon project completion
- 🚫 **Prevention of duplicate renovations** on same property

## 🧪 Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic Renovation Flow (Critical)
1. **Start the app**: `npx expo start`
2. **Buy a property** that can be renovated
3. **Go to Portfolio** → Select property → Tap "Renovate"
4. **Verify cost display** shows materials, labor, permits breakdown
5. **Confirm renovation** → Should navigate to Staff Selection
6. **Select staff member** → Should return to Portfolio
7. **Watch progress bar** → Should update every second
8. **Wait 10-15 seconds** → Renovation should auto-complete

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Progress bar moves from 0% to 100%
- ✅ Timer counts down from ~10 seconds to 0
- ✅ Property value increases by renovation amount
- ✅ "Renovate" button changes to "Renovated" status
- ✅ Staff returns to available hiring list

### Test 2: Timeout Mechanism (Important)
1. **Start renovation** as above
2. **Force close and restart app** during renovation
3. **Check if stuck renovation auto-completes** within 20 seconds

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Stuck projects complete automatically
- ✅ No permanently stuck renovations

### Test 3: Staff Efficiency Impact (Verification)
1. **Compare renovation speeds** with different staff members
2. **Higher efficiency staff** should complete faster
3. **Multiple staff** should speed up renovation

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Staff with 1.2x efficiency complete ~20% faster
- ✅ Progress rate varies based on assigned staff

### Test 4: Error Prevention (Edge Cases)
1. **Try to renovate already renovated property** → Should be blocked
2. **Try to renovate during active renovation** → Should be blocked
3. **Try renovation without enough money** → Should show error

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Proper error messages displayed
- ✅ No duplicate renovation projects created

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Console Logs to Watch For:
```
"Processing completed renovations: [projectId]"
"Completing renovation for PROP123"
"Project PROP123 timed out - marking as complete"
```

### Key State Changes to Verify:
- `renovationProjects[propertyId]` → created then deleted
- `playerAssets[].renovationProgress` → 0 to 100
- `playerAssets[].marketValue` → increases by renovation amount
- `playerAssets[].renovationCompleted` → becomes true
- `staff.hired` → staff removed and returned to availableToHire

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Should be Fixed)
- ❌ ~~Renovations getting stuck indefinitely~~ → **FIXED** with timeout
- ❌ ~~Progress bar not updating~~ → **FIXED** with state sync
- ❌ ~~Value not added upon completion~~ → **FIXED** with proper value handling
- ❌ ~~Staff not returned after completion~~ → **FIXED** with staff cleanup

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Timing Expectations:
- **Without staff**: ~20 seconds completion
- **With 1.0x efficiency staff**: ~10 seconds completion  
- **With 1.2x efficiency staff**: ~8.3 seconds completion
- **Timeout failsafe**: Maximum 20 seconds for any stuck project

### Progress Rate Calculations:
- **Base rate**: 0.5% per second (no staff)
- **With staff**: efficiency_modifier% per second
- **Multiple staff**: Sum of all efficiency modifiers

## ✅ Success Criteria

The renovation system is working correctly if:

1. **Renovations complete automatically** within expected timeframe
2. **Progress bars update in real-time** showing accurate progress
3. **Property values increase** by the correct renovation amount
4. **Staff are properly assigned and returned** to hiring agency
5. **No renovations get permanently stuck** (timeout works)
6. **UI properly prevents** duplicate or invalid renovations

---

## 🚨 If Problems Persist

If renovations still get stuck after these fixes:

1. **Check console logs** for completion messages
2. **Verify property data** has correct `valueIncreaseAfterReno` field
3. **Test timeout mechanism** by waiting 20+ seconds
4. **Check staff assignment** in renovation project data
5. **Restart app** to trigger timeout cleanup of stuck projects

The system now has multiple failsafes to prevent permanent stuck states.
