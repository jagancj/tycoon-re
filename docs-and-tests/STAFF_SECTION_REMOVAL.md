# Staff Section Removal from Home Menu - Complete

## Change Description
Removed the "Staff" navigation button from the HomePage bottom navigation bar to streamline the user interface and workflow.

## Rationale
Users don't need direct access to staff hiring from the main menu because:

1. **Context-based hiring**: Staff are hired during construction projects via `StaffSelectionScreen`
2. **Workflow optimization**: Staff hiring is integrated into the construction process when needed
3. **UI simplification**: Reduces menu clutter and focuses on core actions (Market, Portfolio, Bank)
4. **Better UX**: Users hire staff when they actually need them (during construction) rather than preemptively

## Implementation

### Before:
```javascript
{/* Bottom Navigation Bar with 4 buttons */}
<NavButton text="Market" />
<NavButton text="Portfolio" />  
<NavButton text="Bank" />
<NavButton text="Staff" />  // <-- Removed this
```

### After:
```javascript
{/* Bottom Navigation Bar with 3 buttons */}
<NavButton text="Market" />
<NavButton text="Portfolio" />
<NavButton text="Bank" />
```

## Staff Hiring Workflow (Unchanged)
Staff hiring still works through the proper construction workflow:
1. User selects land for construction
2. User chooses architect and blueprint
3. System navigates to `StaffSelectionScreen` to select supervisor
4. Staff is hired and assigned to the construction project

## Files Modified
- `d:\Cursor\games\tycoon-re\src\HomePage.js` - Removed Staff NavButton from bottom navigation

## Files Unchanged (Intentionally)
- `App.js` - StaffCenter route kept for potential future use
- `StaffCenterScreen.js` - Component preserved for potential future access
- `StaffSelectionScreen.js` - Construction-time staff hiring unchanged

## Impact
- ✅ **Cleaner UI**: Simplified bottom navigation with 3 focused buttons
- ✅ **Better workflow**: Staff hiring remains integrated with construction process
- ✅ **No functionality loss**: All staff hiring capabilities preserved
- ✅ **Improved UX**: Users guided to hire staff when actually needed

The home menu now focuses on the core game actions (Market, Portfolio, Bank) while maintaining full staff hiring functionality through the construction workflow.
