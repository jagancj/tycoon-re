# 💰 EMI LOAN PAYMENT FREQUENCY - FIXED

## ✅ **EMI DEDUCTION FREQUENCY ISSUE RESOLVED**

The loan EMI payment system has been fixed to follow proper monthly payment schedules instead of deducting payments daily.

---

## 🐛 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Previous (Incorrect) Behavior:**
- ❌ **EMI Payments**: Were being deducted EVERY game day (every 20 seconds)
- ❌ **Financial Impact**: Players lost money at 30x the expected rate
- ❌ **Game Balance**: Made loans extremely expensive and unviable

### **Root Cause:**
The `handleDailyFinancials` function was processing EMI payments on every daily cycle without checking if payments were actually due:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN) LOGIC:
updatedActiveLoans = updatedActiveLoans.map(loan => {
  if (newMoney >= loan.emi) {
    newMoney -= loan.emi; // This happened EVERY day!
    // ...
  }
  return loan;
});
```

This meant:
- **Daily EMI Deductions**: Instead of monthly (every 30 days)
- **Massive Over-Payment**: 30x more than intended loan cost
- **Broken Game Economy**: Loans became financially devastating

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **New (Correct) Behavior:**
- ✅ **EMI Payments**: Only deducted when due (monthly - every 30 days)
- ✅ **Payment Schedule**: Respects `nextPaymentDate` field in loan objects
- ✅ **Proper Logging**: Individual EMI payment transactions logged
- ✅ **Tenure Tracking**: Remaining loan tenure properly decremented

### **Fixed Logic:**
```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) LOGIC:
const isPaymentDue = !loan.nextPaymentDate || currentDate >= loan.nextPaymentDate;

if (isPaymentDue && newMoney >= loan.emi) {
  newMoney -= loan.emi;
  const newPrincipal = loan.outstandingPrincipal - loan.emi;

  // Log the EMI payment transaction
  newTransactionLog.unshift({
    id: `TXN_${Date.now()}_emi`,
    date: currentDate,
    description: `EMI Payment: ${loan.type} - ${loan.bank}`,
    amount: -loan.emi,
    category: 'Loan'
  });

  // Return loan with updated principal and next payment date
  return { 
    ...loan, 
    outstandingPrincipal: newPrincipal,
    nextPaymentDate: currentDate + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 30 days
    remainingTenure: Math.max(0, loan.remainingTenure - 1)
  };
}
```
