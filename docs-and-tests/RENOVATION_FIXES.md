# Renovation System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Bar Not Updating ✅
**Problem**: The renovation progress bar in `PortfolioScreen.js` was reading `item?.renovationProgress` from assets, but this field was never updated during the renovation process.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the game loop in `GameContext.js` to sync renovation progress from `renovationProjects` to `playerAssets.renovationProgress`
- Added logic to update `renovationTimeRemaining` field for each renovating asset

### 2. Missing Timer Display ✅
**Problem**: No timer showing time remaining for renovation completion.

**Solution**:
- Added `calculateTimeRemaining()` function that calculates remaining time based on progress and staff efficiency
- Added `formatTimeRemaining()` function to display time in readable format (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Updated PortfolioScreen to display the timer below the progress bar
- Added new styles for timer display

### 3. Value Not Added Upon Completion ✅
**Problem**: Renovation value increase wasn't being properly read from property data and added to property value.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `handleRenovate()` to read `valueIncreaseAfterReno` from property data instead of `renovationData`
- Updated `startRenovation()` to use correct property fields (`asset.renovationCost` and `asset.valueIncreaseAfterReno`)
- Enhanced `handleCompletedRenovations()` to properly add value increase to property market value

### 4. Prevention of Further Renovations ✅
**Problem**: No checks to prevent renovating already renovated properties.

**Solution**:
- Added checks in `startRenovation()` for `asset.renovationCompleted` flag
- Added check for properties currently being renovated (`asset.status === 'Renovating'`)
- Updated PortfolioScreen to hide "Renovate" button for already renovated properties
- Added "Renovated" indicator showing the value increase from last renovation

### 5. Staff Assignment to Renovation Projects ✅
**Problem**: Staff wasn't being properly assigned to renovation projects, affecting progress calculation.

**Solution**:
- Updated `assignStaffToProject()` to properly assign staff to renovation projects
- Fixed progress calculation to account for staff efficiency bonuses
- Ensured staff is returned to hiring agency when renovation completes

## UI Improvements

### PortfolioScreen.js
- Added timer display showing time remaining
- Added progress percentage display
- Added "Renovated" status for completed renovations
- Improved progress bar styling and layout
- Added conditional rendering based on renovation status

### New Styles Added
- `renoHeader`: Flexbox layout for progress header
- `progressPercentage`: Styling for progress percentage text
- `timeRemaining`: Styling for time remaining display
- `disabledButton`: Styling for disabled renovate button

## Technical Details

### Game Loop Changes
- Enhanced game loop to sync renovation progress to player assets
- Added time remaining calculation for each renovating property
- Improved progress tracking and completion detection

### Data Flow
1. Player initiates renovation → `startRenovation()`
2. Game loop updates progress → `updateRenovationProgress()`
3. Progress synced to assets → Game loop modification
4. UI displays progress → PortfolioScreen
5. Renovation completes → `handleCompletedRenovations()`
6. Value added to property → Asset market value updated

### Key Functions Modified
- `updateRenovationProgress()`: Enhanced progress calculation
- `calculateTimeRemaining()`: New function for time estimation
- `startRenovation()`: Fixed data source for costs and values
- `assignStaffToProject()`: Enhanced to update renovation projects
- `handleCompletedRenovations()`: Improved value addition logic
