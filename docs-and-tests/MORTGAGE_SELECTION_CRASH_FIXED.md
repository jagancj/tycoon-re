# Mortgage Selection Crash Fix - Complete

## Issue Description
The app was crashing when users tried to select properties for mortgage applications. This was specifically affecting constructed properties and preventing players from using their completed construction projects as collateral for loans.

## Root Cause Analysis
The mortgage property filtering logic had multiple issues:

### 1. Incompatible Property Structure
**Problem**: Mortgage filters required `baseValue` field, but constructed properties don't have this field.

**Filter Logic (BROKEN)**:
```javascript
asset.baseValue && 
(asset.marketValue || asset.areaAverageValue) && 
!asset.isMortgaged &&
asset.status === 'Owned'
```

**Property Types**:
- **Regular properties**: Have `baseValue`, `marketValue`, `areaAverageValue`
- **Constructed properties**: Have `marketValue` only (no `baseValue`)

### 2. Route Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: SelectAssetScreen passed `selectedAsset` to LoanScreen, but LoanScreen didn't extract it from route.params.

### 3. Property Value Display Issues
**Problem**: UI components used incomplete fallback logic for property value display.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Property Filtering Logic

**SelectAssetScreen.js**:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
const mortgagableAssets = playerAssets.filter(asset => 
  asset.baseValue && 
  (asset.marketValue || asset.areaAverageValue) && 
  !asset.isMortgaged &&
  asset.status === 'Owned'
);

// NEW (FIXED):
const mortgagableAssets = playerAssets.filter(asset => 
  // Must have a market value (constructed properties) or baseValue (regular properties)
  (asset.marketValue || asset.areaAverageValue || asset.baseValue) && 
  !asset.isMortgaged &&
  asset.status === 'Owned'
);
```

**LoanScreen.js**:
```javascript
// Applied same filter fix for mortgagableProperties
```

### 2. Fixed Route Parameter Handling

**LoanScreen.js**:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
const { bank } = route.params;
const [selectedProperty, setSelectedProperty] = useState(null);

// NEW (FIXED):
const { bank, selectedAsset, type } = route.params;
const [loanType, setLoanType] = useState(type || 'Personal');
const [selectedProperty, setSelectedProperty] = useState(selectedAsset || null);
```

### 3. Enhanced Property Value Calculation

**LoanScreen.js - Mortgage calculation**:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
const maxMortgage = Math.floor(selectedProperty.marketValue * currentTerms.maxLoanPercentage);

// NEW (FIXED):
const propertyValue = selectedProperty.marketValue || selectedProperty.areaAverageValue || selectedProperty.baseValue || 0;

if (propertyValue <= 0) {
  console.warn('Property has no valid value for mortgage calculation:', selectedProperty);
  return { terms: currentTerms, maxLoan: 0, minLoan: 0 };
}

const maxMortgage = Math.floor(propertyValue * currentTerms.maxLoanPercentage);
```

### 4. Updated UI Display Logic

**SelectAssetScreen.js & LoanScreen.js**:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
Value: ${(item.marketValue || item.areaAverageValue).toLocaleString()}

// NEW (FIXED):
Value: ${(item.marketValue || item.areaAverageValue || item.baseValue || 0).toLocaleString()}
```

## Verification Results

### Test Results from `test-mortgage-selection.js`:
- ✅ **4 properties tested**: Regular, Constructed, Mortgaged, Under Construction
- ✅ **2 properties eligible**: Regular and Constructed properties
- ✅ **Correct exclusions**: Mortgaged and Under Construction properties excluded
- ✅ **Mortgage calculations**: Both property types calculate correctly

### Specific Validations:
- ✅ **Constructed properties**: Now eligible for mortgage (was crashing before)
- ✅ **Regular properties**: Still work correctly
- ✅ **Already mortgaged**: Correctly excluded
- ✅ **Under construction**: Correctly excluded
- ✅ **Value calculations**: Robust fallback logic prevents crashes

### Example Mortgage Calculations:
- **Regular Property** ($120,000 value): Max mortgage $96,000 (80% LTV)
- **Constructed Property** ($167,000 value): Max mortgage $133,600 (80% LTV)

## Files Modified
- `d:\Cursor\games\tycoon-re\src\SelectAssetScreen.js` - Fixed property filtering and value display
- `d:\Cursor\games\tycoon-re\src\LoanScreen.js` - Fixed route handling, filtering, and value calculations
- `d:\Cursor\games\tycoon-re\docs-and-tests\test-mortgage-selection.js` - Created comprehensive test

## Impact
- ✅ **No more crashes** when selecting properties for mortgage
- ✅ **Constructed properties** can now be used as collateral
- ✅ **Proper validation** prevents invalid mortgage applications
- ✅ **Robust value handling** prevents undefined property value errors
- ✅ **Enhanced user experience** with seamless property selection flow

## Business Logic
The fix ensures that:
1. **All owned properties** with valid market values can be mortgaged
2. **Property type doesn't matter** - regular and constructed properties work equally
3. **Proper exclusions** prevent double-mortgaging and invalid property states
4. **Accurate valuations** ensure fair loan calculations

Players can now successfully use their constructed properties as collateral for loans, unlocking additional financing options for their real estate empire!
